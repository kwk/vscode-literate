# Welcome to learning the C language.

C is a rather old programming language but it is used in famous
projects such as the [Linux Kernel](https://kernel.org).

## Our first program

The objective of our first C program is to print `Hello, World!`
to the screen.

At a high level our first small C program consists of just two parts: 

``` c : <<main.c.*>>= ./src/main.c
<<headers>>
<<functions>>
```

## Headers

Headers are there to add outsource and add functionality into
programs that commonly shared between different programs.

The only thing that we need to pull in here is the functionality 
to print something to the screen. We do this by including `stdio.h`
which is a short for *standard input output*.

``` c : <<headers>>=
#include <stdio.h>
```

## The main program

Every C program has a function called `main`. The skeloton of
every `main` function looks like this: 

``` c : <<functions>>=
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
     <<print code>>
     return 0;
}
```

The final part that does the printing is this:

``` c : <<print code>>=
printf("Hello World\n");
```
